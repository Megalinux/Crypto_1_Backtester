* Backtesting is a process of applying a current strategy to historical data with the objective to determine wich implemented strategy is the best in terms of profit. The profit is determined by sell and buy transactions.

* Crypto_1_Backtester is a backtester tool of trading strategies written by Grando Ruggero. This tool performs a simulation with a single pair of cryptocurrency on a single run and implements a dynamic and static stoploss. The backtester uses an Crypto Asset exchange (among those supported by the [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library) like Poloniex, or Bittrex, or Binance and the Pair (asset/currency) like ETH/BTC, or ETC/BTC  present in these exchanges.  
* Version 0.0.1

* Use of static and dynamic **stoploss**. Create your dinamyc stoploss formula.
* **Visualization** of the strategy progress and result with matplotblib

### Example 1 of strategy ###

```python

self.df1.loc[
            (            
                (

                    (self.qt.crossed_above(self.df1['rsi'], 70))                    
                )         
            ),
            'Sellsignal'] = -1

        self.df1.loc[
            (
                (  
                    (self.qt.crossed_below(self.df1['rsi'], 35)) 
                ) 
            ),
            'Buysignal'] = 1
```

### Example 2 of strategy ###

```python

self.df1.loc[
            (            
                (
                    (self.df1['macd'] < self.df1['macdsignal']) &
                    (self.df1['cci'] >= 100.0)              
                )         
            ),
            'Sellsignal'] = -1

        self.df1.loc[
            (
                (  

                    (self.df1['macd'] > self.df1['macdsignal']) &
                    (self.df1['cci'] <= -50.0)

                ) 
            ),
            'Buysignal'] = 1
```

### Create your dinamyc stoploss

* Create your dinamyc stoploss formula.

1. Modify the parameter tool.stoploss_dinamico_formula on file strategy.py with text editor as following described.

###example 1 ###

```python

tool.stoploss_dinamico_formula = "row.close * tool.stoploss_dinamico_moltiplicatore" 
        
```

### example 2 ###      

```python  

tool.stoploss_dinamico_formula = "row.ema3"

```

### Run ###

1. Configure strategy and parameters on strategy.py with text editor as already described
2. In terminal/cmd go to Your main Backtester's folder.
3. Run BacktestTool by command: python3 backtester_v1 {exchange} {pair}
