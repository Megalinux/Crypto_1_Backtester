self.df1.loc[
            (            
                (

                    (self.qt.crossed_above(self.df1['rsi'], 70))                    
                )         
            ),
            'Sellsignal'] = -1

        self.df1.loc[
            (
                (  
                    (self.qt.crossed_below(self.df1['rsi'], 35)) 
                ) 
            ),
            'Buysignal'] = 1
```

### Example 2 of strategy ###

```python

self.df1.loc[
            (            
                (
                    (self.df1['macd'] < self.df1['macdsignal']) &
                    (self.df1['cci'] >= 100.0)              
                )         
            ),
            'Sellsignal'] = -1

        self.df1.loc[
            (
                (  

                    (self.df1['macd'] > self.df1['macdsignal']) &
                    (self.df1['cci'] <= -50.0)

                ) 
            ),
            'Buysignal'] = 1
```

```

### example 2 ###
